# Markdown Resume Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/there4/markdown-resume.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/there4/markdown-resume)
> Convert markdown to HTML and PDF resumes

Turn a simple Markdown document into an elegant resume with both a perfect
pdf printable format, and a responsive css3 html5 file. You can view a sample
at the [blog post for the project][blog].

## Features

* Multiple styles to choose from: `modern`, `blockish`, `unstyled`, `readable`, `swissen` _(Fork and add more!)_
* PDF generation via [wkhtmltopdf][wkhtmltopdf]
* Responsive design for multiple device viewport sizes
* Simple Markdown formatting
* Single file deployment (no external stylesheets)
* You can now version control and branch your resume.

## Quickstart

  There is no installation or need to run composer. Just download and [run the phar file](https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume/raw/master/bin/md2resume):

```
    ./bin/md2resume html examples/source/sample.md examples/output/
    ./bin/md2resume pdf examples/source/sample.md examples/output/
```

```
## Examples

Choose a template with the -t option.

    `./bin/md2resume html --template blockish examples/source/sample.md examples/output/`

If you want to edit your markdown resume in your editor while watching it
update in your browser, run this command:

    `watch ./bin/md2resume html --refresh yes --template modern examples/source/sample.md examples/output/`

This makes the build script run periodically, and html document will refresh
every two seconds via a meta tag. Open the `./examples/ouput/sample.html` file
in your browser, and then just save your markdown document when you want to see
a fresh preview.

For information about running this inside a Docker container, please read [Issue 46](https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume/issues/46#issuecomment-126520792)
where [Sebastian Klose](https://github.com/sklose) has shared his approach.

## Authoring Your Resume

Markdown is limited to basic html markup. Follow the `examples/source/sample.md`
file  as a guideline. This file includes various headers and several nested
elements. This allows us to construct a semantic HTML document for the resume,
and then use CSS rules to display a nicely formatted resume. Note that because
we have very few ways to nest or identify elements that many of the css rules
are based on descendant and adjacent selectors.

__PLEASE NOTE__: The templates are compiled into the phar archive in the `./bin`
folder. If you intend to edit the templates or add new ones, you'll need to run
this application in the dev mode. See below for more information about doing
this.

## Feature Development

The application is deployed as a compiled phar file. In order to add new
commands, you'll need to first install the dependencies:

* `composer install`

After that, you can run the `md2resume_dev.php` file from the command line.

## Building a Release

1. Tag the repo with the new build number. This will be picked up for both
   the `version` file used by the self update command and placed into the
   phar file.
2. Run `pake build`.
3. Push both the tag and the code.

Check out the pake tooling for more information about the build. Pake will be
installed to `./vendor/bin/pake`. So for instance a complete phar file build
looks like `./vendor/bin/pake build`.

## Acknowledgments

The initial inspiration is from the [Sample Resume Template][srt].
However, no HTML from that project has been used in this. General layout has
been reused, and media queries have been added. It's a nice template, and if you
are a more comfortable with html than markdown, you should use it.
